# -------------------------
# Hotspot Identification: 
# -------------------------

# Spatial analysis to identify hotspots of high transmission rates or clusters 
# of genetically similar infections involves using statistical methods and 
# indices that can detect areas with significantly higher incidences of disease or 
# genetic similarity than would be expected by chance. 
# This analysis can be crucial for targeting interventions 
# and understanding the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases. 
# Here are some commonly used indices and methods for spatial hotspot identification:

# 1. Getis-Ord Gi (Hotspot Analysis)*
# The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic identifies hotspots by comparing local mean values to the overall mean.
# It determines the degree of clustering for high values (hotspots) or low values (cold spots) in spatial data.
# High Gi* values indicate that a location and its neighbors have higher values than expected,
# highlighting potential hotspots of transmission or genetic clusters.
# 
# The Getis Ord Gi* statistic is what is used in "Hot spot analysis."
# It looks at how local spatial variance in a single variable, as mentioned by u/Drewddit.
# It was advanced by Artur Getis and Keith Ord. MGWR is built on Geographically weighted regression,
# which is built on OLS regression. GWR adds a spatial weighted matrix into a
# normal regression equation, as opposed to assuming that there is not local variance.
# Multi-scale and Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression both change that
# matrix to weigh variables differently in an analysis.
# GWR was advanced primarily by Alexander Stewart Fotheringham.
# 
# While MGWR is as easy as pushing a button, I want to caution that GWR is an advanced statistic 
# with ALOT of assumptions you need to consider. MGWR is obviously more advanced. 
# If you are only doing county level analysis, you probably could stick with GWR. 
# I'd recommend ALOT of reading, as you need a strong stats background to really understand 
# these and get into spatial statistics.

# 2. Moran's I
# Moran's I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation that evaluates whether the pattern expressed is clustered, 
# dispersed, or random across the study area. It compares the value of a variable at one location with the value 
# of the same variable at nearby locations. High positive Moran's I values indicate clustering of similar values 
# (e.g., high transmission rates or genetic similarity).

# 3. Geary's C
# Geary's C is another measure of spatial autocorrelation, similar to Moran's I, but it is more sensitive to differences 
# between neighboring locations. It focuses on the dissimilarities between adjacent areas. 
# Values significantly lower than 1 indicate spatial clustering of similar values.
# 
# 
# 4. Kulldorffâ€™s Spatial Scan Statistic
# Used in SaTScan software, this method scans the study area for clusters by moving a circular window across 
# the area and evaluating the likelihood of observing the number of cases within the window by chance. 
# It's widely used for detecting disease outbreaks and can be adapted 
# for identifying clusters of genetically similar infections.
# 
# Performing Spatial Analysis in R
# For spatial analysis in R, you can use packages like sp, sf (for handling spatial data), 
# spdep (for spatial dependence, including Moran's I and Geary's C), and spatialEco (for Getis-Ord Gi*).
# Assuming you have a spatial object `disease_data` with transmission rates or genetic similarity index



# Check if the clustering is significant
